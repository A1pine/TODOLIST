Design Summary

In the "TODOLIST" application, we include some main components in the design.

App Bars: A bottom app bar displays navigation and critical actions at the
bottom of mobile screens, Includes Home page button, Task page button, "Add new
list card button". It puts more focus on features, increases engagement, and
visually anchors the UI.

Top-Calendar: There is a Calendar at the top bar. The date of the calendar is
automatically updated every day as time changes.

List cards: Cards contain content and show necessary information of the
reminder, and after clicking the cards, it can pop up a window, and able to edit
details of the reminder.

Date and time picker: Date and time pickers let users select a date and time to
remind.

Map: when select the location, it will show on the List cards.

Task classification: Classify the even according to daily life, which is simpler
and clearer

Testing Summary

When our group was working on this project, we encountered many problems, such
as the app could not run normally, the function could not be realized and even
the version issues. So, we adopted Junit to test, update the task, Edit the task
and delete the task then solve those problems, so that rh program development
could run normally.
